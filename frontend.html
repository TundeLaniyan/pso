            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is
            the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or
            Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
            directly. The challenge associated with front end development is
            that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a
            website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly
            be aware of how the field is developing.

            The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users
            open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy
            to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that
            users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes
            and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration
            these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that
            their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser),
            different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices
            (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the
            developer

            Our front-end developers are responsible for a website’s user-facing
            code and the architecture of its immersive user experiences. In
            order to execute those objectives, front-end devs must be adept at
            three main languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming. In
            addition to fluency in these languages, our front-end devs are
            familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, React, jQuery, which ensure
            great-looking content no matter the device. Our front-end developer
            also have experience with Ajax, a widely used technique for using
            Javascript that lets pages dynamically load by downloading server
            data in the background.
